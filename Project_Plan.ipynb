    "## Abstract  \n",
    "TED is a nonprofit organization born in 1984. Originally, it was set up as a platform for professionals to share their innovative ideas and the topics were restricted in technology, entertainment and design fields. Nowadays, TED has already become an unparalleled phenomenon, attracting millions of people worldwide to watch, present, discuss and think on hundreds of topics. With such diverse range of topics and speakers, which TED Talks are popular and why? Current TED Talks popularity studies are generally quite shallow as listing the top viewed talks or the top speakers, deeper studies based on real-world data to answer the question of what are the specific factors that contribute to TED Talks popularity are lacking. Therefore, I propose this study to answer 5 research questions that relates to TED Talks popularity and reflect on ways of how can we use the results of this study to understand TED talks audiences and design better TED talks in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I want to study TED and why it matters\n",
    "According to the official TED blog, as of 2015 \"There are 450,000 people log on to TED.com every day, and TED Talks are viewed some 100 million times every month - 1.2 billion times a year\". These numbers are already tremendous. Let alone the new TEDx program which was launched in 2009 to host talks in local communities. According to the offical TED blog, \"TEDx archive has reached 100,000 talks in 2017 in 190 countries and over 2500 cities\". One may argue TED's user number is not comparable to the most popular social media website (Facebook, with 1.37 billion daily active users). Nevertheless, considering the nature of TED, which is more of education than entertainment, it has achieved unprallel popularity worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many intriguing questions behind the TED phenomenon. What made it so popular? To answer this question, I think we should go deeper and divide the question up as two: 1) which talks are popular and 2) why are these talks popular? The answers to these questions matter because they will help guid TED designers to understand what do TED audiences care about and how can they better design future TED talks, which will in turn increase popularity of TED and enlarge TED influence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we know already about TED popularity\n",
    "Why TED talks are popular? There could be many reasons contribute to its impact and influence. I have listed here a few reasons that are mostly agreed upon on the internet. \n",
    "* TED Talks are free online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted Talks have been posted online for free for the past 10 years, anyone with internet access will be able to view Ted Talks and be inspired. The fact that they are free contribute to their wide reach and impact to people with even limited resources.\n",
    "* TED Talks cover a diverse range of topics\n",
    "\n",
    "TED started with topics restricted in technology, entertainment and design, what this name stands for. However, TED topics have been much expanded over the past 30 years. Nowadays, TED topics can be ranged from science, business, art to global issues. The speakers are from diverse backgrounds as well. Therefore, people with completely different interest and desires may still find their common destination to be inspired as of TED.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* TED Talks are short and focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to TED curator Chris Anderson who enforced an 18-minute maximum length, it was \"long enough to be serious and short enough to hold people's attention\". The strategy seems very effective since it fits human nature to focus for a short amount of time. My personal observation is that short talks are more effective because people can take advantage of their fragmented. time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we don't know about TED popularity\n",
    "We already know TED Talks matter and they are popular. However, there are still tremendous intriguing questions behind TED phenomenon. With such diverse range of topics and speakers, which TED Talks are popular, which topics are more popular? Why do they popular? There could many reasons contributing to the popularity, topics, time, speaker and even presentation skills. However, current TED Talks popularity studies are generally quite shallow such as listing [The most popular talks of all time](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all) or the top speakers. Deeper studies based on real-world data to answer the question of what are the specific factors that contribute to TED Talks popularity are lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Do I Want to Learn from This Study\n",
    "I'd like to conduct TED talks popularity data science studies based on real data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How do you define TED talks popularity?\n",
    "* Which TED talks are popular?\n",
    "* Which topics/themes are more popular?\n",
    "* Why some talks are more popular? Is it because of topics, time, speaker or even presentation skills?\n",
    "* How can we use the results of this study to design TED topics to make bigger impact and appeal more people? \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve the above goals, 5 research questions are designed and corresponding hypotheses are proposed in section 2. Analytical methods and why are they appropriate for each research question will be illustrated in section 2 as well as section 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknowns and Limitations of This Study\n",
    "* Data source contents limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two data sets I'll be using for this study (see details in section 3). There are 18 variables and ~2500 records in total, a rich data set in general. However, limitations exist as \n",
    "1) Only TED talks that have been posted online will be available. Large amounts of TED Talks that were given in local communities without free online records would not be included in this study. \n",
    "2) Only TED talks on US official website will be included in this study. In a perfect scenario, I would like to analyze TED talks popularity globally since TED's impact globally is also an important aspect of popularity. \n",
    "3) I can only dig popularity related factors from available data. For example, popularity will only be defined based on information in existing data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data source validity\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sets will be collected from Kaggle, originally scraped from the official TED Website. It is not entirely certain that there is no errors during the scraping process and all information is valid and correct. However, in general, the data sets are clean and robust."

    "## 2. Research Questions\n",
    "### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1 RQ1: Define Popularity\n",
    "In order to answer the research questions surrounding TED Talks popularity, popularity needs to be defined clearly first and foremost. I'd like to define popularity from the following four aspects: number of views, number of comments, number of comments per view, and number of languages. Each of these variables explains a unique aspect of popularity. Number of views suggests the general degree of attention received from the audience and maybe the most representative factor for popularity. Number of comments, on the other hand, leans more towards measuring how much the talks inspired the audience to reflect and discuss. Comments per view, combines the measurements of view and comment, defines the amount of reflection and discussion more precisely on a per view unit. Number of languages, relates more closely to the global impacts of TED talks and measures the popularity in terms of how wide the impacts on the dimension of geography and culture. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research question is extremely important and set constraints for the rest four questions, as all the four factors will be used to gauge and compare popularity between different TED talks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.1 Number of views\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.2 Number of comments\n",

    "The answers to which TED talks are popular are available on TED official website. However, there are hundreds of different topics out of all the past TED talks, it is not clear which specific topics are more popular. I'd like to explore the answers to this question as well as why do some topics are more popular by studying deeper on the ratings and comments of these talks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.1 Hypothesis2a Ted Topics related to technology, entertainment and design are more popular.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.2 Hypothesis2b Some topics are more popular because they are informative rather than funny or surprising.\n",

    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.3.1 Hypothesis3a TED Talks are becoming more and more popular over the past 10 years.\n",
    "As time goes by, more and more people are able to access internet which should contribute to TED Talks' spread. Therefore, I hypothesize that TED Talks has becoming more and more popular over the past 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.3.2 Hypothesis3b TED Talks popularity is not related to published months.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.3.3 Hypothesis3c TED Talks are more popular on weekends than weekdays. \n",
    "TED Talks are aiming to spread ideas, educate people and inspire impacts. Most of them are not particularly designed for the purpose of learning on specific skills or training on specific techniques. Therefore, I hypothesize that people will more likely to watch TED Talks on weekends rather than weekdays."

    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.4.1 Hypothesis4a Top popular speakers will be different when measuring popularity in terms of views, comments, comments per view and number of languages.\n",
    "It is not difficult to give a list of top speakers. However, I'm most curious to know how such lists change when gauging popularity with different variables including number of views, number of comments, number of comments per view and number of languages. My hypothesis top speakers list is not static, it will be quite different when we see popularity from different angles.\n",

    "TED Talks are short presentations and require sophisticated presentation skills to not only interesting enough to draw audiences' attention, but also serious enough to deliver the ideas in a short amount of time. Presentation skills are doubtless important and should be one of the reasons why some talks are more popular than others. In this section, I'll explore how presentation skills relates to popularity based on the available data. \n",

    "The actual TED Talks lengths range from 10 minutes to 40 minutes or also. If they are too short, there may not be adequate time to convey the ideas, persuade the audience and inpspire discussions. If they are too long, the audiences may easily lost attention and fail to concentrate. Therefore, I hypothesize that mediun length TED Talks are more popular, i.e. 20 minutes or so.\n",

    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.2 Hypothesis5b TED Talks that started with a question are more popular\n",

    "#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5.3 Hypothesis5c TED Talks presented in humorous ways are more popular\n",
    "Another presentation skill is to give presentations in humorous ways that stimulate laughter. The audiences may remember the presentation contents better on interesting talks than talks that are too serious. In this part of study, I'll explore deeper on presentation scripts and study the relationship between indicators of laughter and talks popularity."
